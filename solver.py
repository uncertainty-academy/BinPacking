"""
PyMzn is a Python library that wraps the MiniZinc tools for constraint programming. PyMzn is built on top
of the minizinc and enables to parse the solutions into Python objects. Author: Paolo Dragone, PhD student at the
University of Trento (Italy).

Minizic is an open-source constraint modeling language. Minizinc compiles the model into FlatZinc, a low-level
common input language that is understood by a wide range of solvers. The solver used is Gecode, an open source C++
toolkit for developing constraint-based applications and is included in the Minizinc package.
